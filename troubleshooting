We plan to use data from page 24 of http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5300/sc5339/000113/019000/019833/unrestricted/20140928e.pdf to look at juvenile court filings and terminations from 2013. Proceeding from our data to our physical project, we're having trouble deciding how to adapt that data to the type of project you're looking for. We were thinking of making an interactive chart with dropdown menus, but weren't sure if that's the type of thing you had in mind.
