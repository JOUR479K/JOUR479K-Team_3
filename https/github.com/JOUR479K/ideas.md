Team 3 Ideas

1. Lead poisoning rates in Baltimore, correlated with when the homes were built and the income of the families

2. Juvenile convictions in different district court jurisdictions around Maryland, or in district courts vs. federal circuit courts

3. Comparing state gun laws to the rates of homicide or injury by firearms


EDITS FOR MARCH 9:
We will work either on juvenile convictions or gun ownership.
For juvenile convictions, we found county-by-county Maryland data that discusses what juveniles tried by adults for were charged with, so we'd like to compare counties and analyze that data using information about income, race and other social factors.
For gun laws, we would compare the number of guns owned per thousand people in each state to the number of homicides by firearms, and possibly visually compare the two using heat maps.
